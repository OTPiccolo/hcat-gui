# Haplotype Comparison and Analysis Tool (HCAT)
## Graphical User Interface (GUI)

### Overview
HCAT is a tool to help all scientists out there to analyze their sequence data faster and more reliable, by utilizing the strengths of a computer to automate repetitive tasks in a uniform way. No longer do you have to waste hours painstakingly categorizing sequence data into haplotypes, always fearing that you might slip up somewhere and by thus invalidating all the hard work you did.

With this tool, you can...
* Easily group sequnces into haplotypes
* Compare those haplotypes to a master sequence to show the positions where they differ
* Display a distance matrix
* Cut sequences
* Translate sequences into codons, all translation tables pre-configured

It can read in and write out sequences in different formats, like...
* Fasta
* Phylip (normal and TCS)
* CSV (Comma Separated Value)
